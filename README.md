DiGATe-UNet: Lightweight Dual-Stream Framework for Landslide Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of our lightweight dual-stream Siamese framework for landslide segmentation from remote sensing imagery. The model integrates optical and topographical data fusion, an adaptive decoder with lightweight cross-attention, gated fusion, and deep supervision to achieve accurate boundary delineation and robust performance across diverse landscapes.

ðŸ“Œ Current content: inference.ipynb notebook for running segmentation inference on the Bijie dataset. (example usage)
ðŸ“Œ Upcoming updates: Full training pipeline, model implementation, and benchmark datasets integration will be added soon.
